                        Permitting to facilitate construction of improvements is a critical element in the overall project 
                        management process. Permitting can be extremely time consuming and may result in project delays and cost 
                        overruns. It is therefore critical that members of the design team work closely with the client, 
                        other consultants, and the respective agencies to identify issues of importance to regulatory 
                        agencies during early stages of the design process.
                        <br/><br/>
                        To facilitate an orderly flow of our design services, Catalyst Technical Group utilizes a hands-on 
                        approach, meeting early in the process with any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the 
                        site to evaluate their standards and assess the issues relative to their approval process. Our 
                        project approach includes permitting as a specific task in our scheduling process and given the 
                        magnitude of the assignment, schedules may be updated more frequently to assure compliance 
                        with the overall project schedule.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Catalyst Technical Group is thoroughly familiar with the permitting process and our experience 
                        in dealing with the regulatory agencies enables us to secure the necessary permits in a most 
                        expeditious manner.
