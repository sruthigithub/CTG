                               Permitting to facilitate construction of improvements is a critical element in the overall project 
                            management process. Permitting can be extremely time consuming and may result in project delays and cost 
                            overruns. It is therefore critical that members of the design team work closely with the client, 
                            other consultants, and the respective agencies to identify issues of importance to regulatory 
                            agencies during early stages of the design process.

                            To facilitate an orderly flow of our design services, Catalyst Technical Group utilizes a hands-on 
                            approach, meeting early in the process with any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the 
                            site to evaluate their standards and assess the issues relative to their approval process. Our 
                            project approach includes permitting as a specific task in our scheduling process and given the 
                            magnitude of the assignment, schedules may be updated more frequently to assure compliance 
                            with the overall project schedule.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Catalyst Technical Group is thoroughly familiar with the permitting process and our experience 
                            in dealing with the regulatory agencies enables us to secure the necessary permits in a most 
                            expeditious manner.

                            To facilitate an orderly flow of our design services, Catalyst Technical Group utilizes a hands-on 
                            approach, meeting early in the process with any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the 
                            site to evaluate their standards and assess the issues relative to their approval process. Our 
                            project approach includes permitting as a specific task in our scheduling process and given the 
                            magnitude of the assignment, schedules may be updated more frequently to assure compliance 
                            with the overall project schedule.

                            Catalyst Technical Group is thoroughly familiar with the permitting process and our experience 
                            in dealing with the regulatory agencies enables us to secure the necessary permits in a most 
                            expeditious manner.
